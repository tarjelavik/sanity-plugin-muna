# Muna - Sanity schema

**Muna** or *remember* in norse is a schema plugin for [Sanity](https://sanity.io) that enables detailed descriptions of cultural heritage objects and knowledge about their contexts. Muna is inspired by [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) and [linked.art](https://linked.art). 

Muna tries to combine the expressiveness of CIDOC-CRM and the customizable editor Sanity. Objects can connected to events, actors, reports and loads more. If you have a good knowledge of CIDOC-CRM and is willing to try a rather untested schema here is the way to get started!

```bash
npm install -g @sanity/cli
sanity init
sanity install muna
sanity start
```

The Sanity studio will fire up on `http://localhost:3333/`.

## TODO

* [ ] Improve schema
* [ ] Add documentation
* [ ] Add deskStructure.js example
